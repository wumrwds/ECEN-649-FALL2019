### How to Run the Project

This project is written in Python.

To run the train the large scale of images of 19 x 19, you can run the `main.py` and it will take about 5 hours:

```shell
$ python main.py
```

To run the train the small scale of images of window 8 x 8, you can run the `testing.py` and it only takes 3-5 minutes:

```shell
$ python test.py
```

The library I only used externally is numpy.
